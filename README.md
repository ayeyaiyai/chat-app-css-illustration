# chat-app-css-illustration
This is my solution to the frontendmentor.io chat app CSS illustration challenge. It is a tier 3 challenge. This is my first project using Vite and Typescript. It also features mobile styling. Please note that this is just a mock-up, and does not feature chat functionality. You can find a live preview of the website below.
